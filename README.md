I learned from the Internet a lot of about programming in Python.
To say Thank you! I decided to share with you my notebooks.
Human being should learn whole life.


First part with fundamentals of Python language I wrote in my nataional language - Polish. 

After few years I get possibility to switch my path in IT from ETL/DB directly to Python.
So I decided back to write this blog - **Around Python**.
